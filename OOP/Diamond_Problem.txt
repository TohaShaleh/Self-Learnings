# Virtual inheritance is used to avoid the diamond problem (multiple instances of the same base class being created).




#Explanation :

Virtual Inheritance: This ensures that there is only one base class a in the derived class d, even though d inherits from both b and c.

# Virtual Methods: The aa() method is virtual, meaning it can be overridden in derived classes if needed.






## The Diamond Problem ::
Let's break down the scenario to understand how virtual inheritance works here:

Base Class (a):
class a is the base class with a method aa().

Intermediate Classes (b and c):
class b and class c inherit from a. Since both inherit from the same base class a, without virtual inheritance, there would be two separate instances of a in any class that inherits from both b and c.

Derived Class (d):
class d inherits from both b and c. If b and c were to inherit from a normally (i.e., without virtual inheritance), d would have two instances of a: one from b and one from c. This creates ambiguity, as it's unclear which instance of a should be used when calling aa() from d.




## How Virtual Inheritance Solves the Problem ?
With virtual inheritance, the C++ compiler ensures that only one instance of the base class a is shared among all classes derived from it, no matter how complex the inheritance hierarchy is.





## Why we have used Virtual keyword infront of the method ?

The virtual keyword in C++ is used to indicate that a function is a virtual function. Virtual functions are primarily used when you want to allow a function to be overridden in a derived class and ensure that the correct function is called based on the actual type of the object, even when using a base class pointer or reference. This is a key feature for achieving runtime polymorphism.






## What is Instance of a class ? 

i) An instance of a class is a specific object created from the class definition.

ii) Each instance has its own separate memory space for storing data members and can use the methods defined by the class.

iii) While the class defines the structure and behavior, an instance is the actual "thing" in memory that you interact with in your program.
